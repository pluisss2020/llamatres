Distribution overview:

1. Directory "chatserver" contains server-side chat script.
   Modify configuration variables in the init.php file
   (follow guidelines therein).
   After that launch messenger.php script from any browser.
   You can use cronjobs or other methods to launch this script automatically.

2. Directory "chatclient" contains java applet.

3. Main directory contains chat files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
   You can modify all of these files to customize the look of the chat and
   its functionality to your site
   (however you may not distribute such modified versions).
   At minimum, you'll need to modify host and port parameters for 
   <applet> and <object> tags in the chat.html file.

Thx for using my scripts :)
